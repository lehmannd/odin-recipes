    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This roasted garlic pasta showcases the sweet, mellow, rich, and nutty flavors that develop when you roast garlic. It’s a date-night-worthy meal, especially if you add sea scallops on top—I usually do—but it is delicious as is, too. My favorite scallop recipe is in the note below.</p>
