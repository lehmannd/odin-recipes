    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a heavy skillet. Turn heat to medium high heat. Add the sausage links, and cook on all four sides until browned, about 5 minutes. Move sausage to the side. Add onions and bell pepper; cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 of tomatoes with liquid into the skillet. Take remaining tomatoes and blend until liquified; pour blended tomatoes into the skillet. Stir in Italian seasoning, orzo, and chicken broth until well blended.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook for 10 minutes. Remove links and slice into coin-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Add half and half and spinach; allow spinach to wilt down, about 2 minutes. Stir in sliced sausage, Parmesan cheese, and crushed red pepper. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
