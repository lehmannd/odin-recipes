    <!--Ingredients Section-->

        <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can tomato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vodka</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 leaves basil, cut into very thin strips</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Directions Section-->
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a deep cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Sprinkle chicken with 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Set remaining seasoning aside.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to the skillet. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a cutting board; keep warm.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir shallot and garlic in the same skillet until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Stir in tomato pur√©e, remaining Italian seasoning, remaining salt, and red pepper flakes; bring to a simmer. Stir in whipping cream and vodka. Stir in Parmesan until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Slice chicken into thin strips; and add to the skillet. Drain pasta; reserving 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the skillet. Toss to combine. If sauce seems too thick, add in pasta water 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. Sprinkle penne with julienned basil. Serve immediately.</li>
